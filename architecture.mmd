**Notes:**

*   This diagram simplifies the setup slightly for clarity (e.g., showing RDS as potentially multi-AZ across the DB subnets).
*   ECS Service/Tasks represent the compute layer placed in private subnets.
*   The Application Load Balancer (ALB) spans the public subnets.
*   NAT Gateways reside in public subnets and provide outbound internet access for private resources.
*   RDS instances reside in the DB subnets.
*   Arrows indicate primary traffic flow or dependencies.
